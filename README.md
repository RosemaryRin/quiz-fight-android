# QuizFight - An Android trivia quiz application
## Project for "Mobile Programming" course at University of Padua (Computer Science - master degree)

The benefits of a gaming approach for learning are well-known. In fact, people learn better and more when they play games. We are never tired of playing. After all, **games mean fun**. And fun means that our minds are relaxed and open for gaining new knowledge.

This is why, over the last few years, scientists have begun to commission more and more scientific games.
The goal is to involve people in science and let them learn new things.

Furthermore, nowadays there are many game shows that let people test their trivia knowledge. They are fun and useful because they allow both competitors and audience to learn new things, while playing.
We develop QuizFight, a trivia quiz application allowing users to test their **trivia knowledge**.

## Duels

Users can dare each other with duels in three different topics (such as science, literature, etc...).
Users can also choose to generate random topics for a duel.

A duel comprises of three different rounds each of which comprises of five questions.
Each question has an associate difficulty level determining its score. Difficulty levels range in [1, 3].
